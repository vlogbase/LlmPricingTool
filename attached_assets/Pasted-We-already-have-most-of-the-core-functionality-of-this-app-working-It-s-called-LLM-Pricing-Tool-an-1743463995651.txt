We already have most of the core functionality of this app working. It's called LLM Pricing Tool, and it's designed to:
Let me monitor current prices for LLM models (my own prices vs OpenRouter's prices)


Edit and schedule future price changes


Eventually serve data to another app (Gloriamundo)


You’ve already implemented:
Live OpenRouter price fetching


My own current and new price settings


Scheduling logic (with backend support)


A mostly working UI with “Current Prices” and “New Prices” tabs


We’ve iterated on this a bit now, and I want to clarify the overall vision and make some changes to bring everything into line.



💻 UI Layout
Keep the existing tab-based layout, but expand it slightly to include:
✅ Current Prices — show:


My current price


OpenRouter live price


Difference (highlight red if OpenRouter is higher than mine)


A “refresh” button to manually reload OpenRouter prices


✅ New Prices — editable fields for setting new prices


At the bottom, instead of scheduling each price individually, show a single "Schedule All Price Changes" button


Let me pick a datetime for the change to go live


➕ Scheduled Changes tab — list all scheduled changes with:


Time they’re set to go live


Summary of model prices


Cancel button


➕ History tab — show:


When prices were changed


What they were before, and what they became



⚙️ Backend Enhancements
Add logic to store and show previous prices and change timestamps


Background job already applies scheduled changes — keep this working


Allow prices to be retrieved and updated through an API for Gloriamundo, including:


GET current prices


GET upcoming scheduled change


POST manual price change trigger


(Protect with API key or allow from gloriamundo.com only)



🔔 Notifications & PWA
Add support for in-browser notifications, especially:


If a current price is lower than OpenRouter (possible loss)


When a scheduled price change is about to go live (e.g. 5 mins before)


If possible, make the app installable as a PWA so I can use it on mobile and still receive notifications



🧹 Summary
We’re not starting from scratch — we’re just cleaning this up and getting everything aligned. Please:
Review what already exists


Implement/adjust the rest of the features based on this clarified spec


Let me know once it’s fully working so I can test everything



Let me know if you need help testing any part of it or want a feature broken down in more detail.
